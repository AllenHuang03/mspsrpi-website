      "The PSRπ project was the first large-scale pulsar astrometry program using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), focusing on measuring precise distances and velocities of radio pulsars through parallax and proper motion determinations.",
      "From 2010 to 2013, we conducted a systematic campaign of observations targeting 60 carefully selected pulsars distributed across the Galactic plane. By implementing innovative phase-referencing techniques, we achieved unprecedented astrometric precision for these distant neutron stars.",
      "This pioneering project resulted in 53 significant parallax measurements, which represented a dramatic increase in the number of pulsars with well-measured distances. These measurements have helped refine pulsar population models, improved our understanding of the Galactic electron density distribution, and provided valuable insights into neutron star formation mechanisms."

      "The PSRπ program utilized the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at L-band (1.4 GHz) to achieve the highest possible astrometric precision. Each target pulsar was observed at 6-8 epochs spread over approximately 2 years, with epochs strategically scheduled near the times of maximum parallactic excursion.",
      "We implemented phase-referencing techniques to calibrate atmospheric effects, using compact extragalactic radio sources as position references. For many targets, we included observations of in-beam calibrators — background sources that appear in the same primary beam as the target pulsar — to reduce systematic errors.",
      "To optimize sensitivity for the relatively faint pulsar signals, we implemented pulsar gating during correlation. This technique increases the signal-to-noise ratio by accumulating data only during the on-pulse portion of the pulsar's rotation, effectively reducing the noise contribution from the off-pulse intervals.",
      "Data calibration and imaging were performed using a customized pipeline developed specifically for pulsar astrometry, addressing the unique challenges of these observations. Positional measurements and their uncertainties were determined through fitting to the interferometric images, with careful attention to systematic error analysis."

These improvements benefit not only pulsar astronomy but also studies of fast radio bursts and other transient phenomena.",
