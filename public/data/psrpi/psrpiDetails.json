The VLBA can measure the parallax and proper motion of pulsars as faint as approximately 1 mJy to a typical accuracy of around 40 microarcseconds and 40 microarcseconds/year respectively.",
    "We have been approved for 760 hours of VLBA time from 2011 to 2013. Of this, approximately 100 hours were used to search for in-beam calibrators for the astrometric observations. During this in-beam search, we imaged around 10,000 potential calibrators, making this one of the largest VLBI surveys ever.",
    "Observations for the initial PSRπ sample of 60 pulsars have now concluded. 84.7 hours were observed on the VLBA (plus 12 hours from a pilot project) searching for in-beam calibrators around 245 pulsars, and 690.2 hours were utilised for 285 astrometric observations. The median target-calibrator separation is 14.5' and the median inbeam calibrator flux is 9.2 mJy."

    "To obtain our quality astrometric results, we observe 8 epochs on each source with the VLBA. Each source has an associated in-beam calibrator to reduce the systematic error contributions of the ionosphere. These in beam sources are located using an efficient multiple field search with the DiFX software correlator of the VLBA.",
    "The VLBA can measure the parallax and proper motion of pulsars as faint as approximately 1 mJy to a typical accuracy of around 40 microarcseconds and 40 microarcseconds/year respectively. This is sufficient to calculate the distance and velocity of a source at 4 kpc - halfway to the Galactic center - to an accuracy of around 15%.",
    "For the first phase, we inspected candidate in-beams for 245 potential target pulsars and selected 60 for immediate astrometric observations. The median target-calibrator separation is 14.5' and the median inbeam calibrator flux is 9.2 mJy.",

  "scientificImpact": [
    "The PSRπ program has fundamentally transformed our understanding of the Galactic pulsar population. By providing model-independent distances to a statistically significant sample of pulsars, we have placed pulsar population studies on a firm empirical foundation.",

These improvements benefit not only pulsar astronomy but also studies of fast radio bursts and other transient phenomena.",
