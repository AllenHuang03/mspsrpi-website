This phase targeted 18 MSPs with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), achieving sub-milliarcsecond precision for parallax and proper motion measurements.",

    "overview": [
      "The MSPSRπ project was designed as a dedicated follow-up to the original PSRπ project, with a targeted focus on millisecond pulsars (MSPs) that are critical for tests of gravity and gravitational wave detection through pulsar timing arrays (PTAs).",
      "Using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), we conducted a series of observations of 18 carefully selected MSPs over a 4-year period. By implementing advanced phase-referencing techniques, we achieved unprecedented astrometric precision for these distant cosmic timekeepers.",
      "The project resulted in 15 significant parallax measurements, roughly tripling the small number of MSPs with well-measured astrometric parameters. These measurements have contributed to enhanced tests of gravitational theories, improved our understanding of the Galactic electron distribution, and provided insights into the kinematic properties of the MSP population."

      "MSPSRπ utilized the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at L-band (1.4 GHz) to achieve the highest possible astrometric precision. The observations were designed to maximize parallax sensitivity by scheduling sessions near the times of maximum parallactic excursion.",
      "We implemented relayed phase-referencing techniques, where a secondary phase reference source very close to the target pulsar was observed to refine direction-dependent calibration effects. For three pulsars, we employed 1D interpolation to further suppress propagation-related systematic errors.",
      "Pulsar gating was applied during correlation to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, effectively leveraging our knowledge of the pulsars' rotational phases to exclude off-pulse data. This resulted in an average improvement in sensitivity of a factor of approximately 1.8.",
      "All data was processed with our custom psrvlbireduce pipeline, which automates many aspects of the calibration and imaging process. Systematic error analysis was performed using a Bayesian approach with the sterne package, specifically developed for this project."
